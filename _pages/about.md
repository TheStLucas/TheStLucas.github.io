I am a PhD candidate at Washington University in St. Louis, where I am supervised by Prof. [William Yeoh](https://sites.wustl.edu/wyeoh/). Prior to this, I received a MSc. in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Southampton (UK), supervised by Prof. [Long Tran-Thanh](https://human-agentlearning.github.io/HAL-LAB.html), a MSc. in Applied Mathematics from the University of Glasgow (UK), supervised by Prof. [Radostin Simitev](https://www.maths.gla.ac.uk/~rs/), and finally a BSc. from the University of the Aegean (GR), supervised by Prof. [Nikolaos Kavallaris](https://www1.chester.ac.uk/departments/mathematics/staff/nikos-kavallaris).

Currently, my research revolves around explainable AI from the perspective of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning. In particular, I am investigating a logic-based, human-in-the-loop, framework that can learn human models in an interactive fashion, and provide personalized explanations about a specific task.
